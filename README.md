# SymDiffer
**Introduction**: SymDiffer Information Center

This repository has the code that implements the operations of the SymDiffer math toolkit. "Director" classes represent
the operations that the tookit offers. Nested modules may or may not have further "supplementary" documentation (the
code itself being the main documentation that's being supplemented) on what they do to help you navigate the code.
